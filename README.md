    * System shows the current line chart of the selected stock.
    * User can view the chart by selecting different time ranges.
    * User can hover their cursor on the line chart and it would show the price at the timestamp
* **Alternative flow:**

    * Update the holdings, lots and simulated money amount
    * Recalculated the profit or loss
* **Alternative flow:**
    * No recent price available (e.g., off the market or internet stability issues) after clicking the submit button → ask user to refresh the market
    * Not enough simulated money → notify the user “Not enough money” and show user a button to add more simulated money if they want

**Use Case 5:** Portfolio performance diagnostics

#### **Proposed API**

Alpha Vantage  
[https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)

* For our use case 3: “Fetch Selected Live Stock Prices”, we would use the Ticker Search (SYMBOL\_SEARCH) from this api to help us display correct symbol results.  When the user types a company name or symbol letter, the list will return the best-match symbols.
* We would use TIME\_SERIES\_DAILY, TIME\_SERIES\_WEEKLY, TIME\_SERIES\_MONTHLY to help us view the line chart of Stock performance
* We also use NEWS\_SENTIMENT from this API to fetch real-time news
* We would also use GLOBAL\_QUOTE from this API to return the latest price and volume information for selected symbol.
